# Day 7: SQL Fundamentals - One Day Complete Guide

## 🎯 Goal
By the end of this day, students will understand how to store, retrieve, combine, and analyze data using SQL. They will be able to write joins confidently, understand subqueries, and read CTE syntax without fear.

---

## 📚 Session Structure

### ☀️ **Session 1** (First 1.5 hours) - Basics + Setup
**Goal:** Students understand data storage

**Topics:**
- Creating databases
- Creating tables
- Understanding primary keys
- Inserting data
- Table relationships (lightly)

**Files:** 
- [01_database_setup.sql](01_database_setup.sql)
- [02_create_tables.sql](02_create_tables.sql)
- [03_insert_data.sql](03_insert_data.sql)

---

### ☀️ **Session 2** (Next 1 hour) - SELECT + Filtering
**Goal:** Build confidence with basic queries

**Topics:**
- SELECT statements
- Filtering with WHERE
- Sorting with ORDER BY
- Basic conditions

**Files:**
- [04_select_basics.sql](04_select_basics.sql)

---

### 🍽️ **Session 3** (Before Lunch) - Joins (MOST IMPORTANT)
**Goal:** Understand how to combine data from multiple tables

**Story:** "Data is split into different tables. JOIN combines them."

**Topics:**
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN (optional)
- Understanding ON conditions
- Real-world use cases

**Files:**
- [05_joins.sql](05_joins.sql)

---

### 🌤️ **Session 4** (After Lunch) - Aggregate Functions + GROUP BY
**Goal:** Learn to summarize and analyze data

**Topics:**
- COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN
- GROUP BY clause
- Answering analytical questions

**Files:**
- [06_aggregates_groupby.sql](06_aggregates_groupby.sql)

---

### 🌇 **Session 5** (Advanced but Simple) - Subqueries
**Goal:** Demystify subqueries

**Explanation:** "Query inside another query."

**Topics:**
- What are subqueries
- When to use them
- Practical examples

**Files:**
- [07_subqueries.sql](07_subqueries.sql)

---

### 🌆 **Session 6** (Modern SQL) - Common Table Expressions (CTE)
**Goal:** Simplify complex queries

**Explanation:** "CTE is just a temporary named result."

**Topics:**
- WITH clause
- Making queries readable
- Converting subqueries to CTEs

**Files:**
- [08_cte.sql](08_cte.sql)

---

### 🌙 **Session 7** (Final 1 hour) - Mini Project Tasks
**Goal:** Make students feel like experts

**Practice Problems:**
1. List students with course names
2. Find top scorer
3. Average marks per course
4. Students not enrolled in any course
5. Course with highest average

**Files:**
- [09_mini_project.sql](09_mini_project.sql)

## 🧑‍🏫 Golden Teaching Flow

Each new concept answers a question:

| Question | Concept |
|----------|---------|
| How to store data? | CREATE TABLE |
| How to view data? | SELECT |
| How to combine tables? | JOIN |
| How to summarize? | GROUP BY |
| How to filter using results? | SUBQUERY |
| How to simplify complex queries? | CTE |

## ⭐ What NOT to Do (Common Teacher Mistakes)

❌ Don't explain theory for 2 hours  
❌ Don't teach syntax without real questions  
❌ Don't start with normalization or ER diagrams  

---

## 🔥 End of Day Result (Realistic)

Students won't be "industry experts" in one day — but they WILL:

✅ Think like SQL users  
✅ Write joins confidently  
✅ Understand subqueries  
✅ Read CTE syntax without fear  

**That is true success.**

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Run files in order (01 through 09)
2. Each file builds on the previous one
3. Practice queries after each session
4. Ask questions when confused

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Understand, don't memorize** - Focus on why, not just how
- **Practice with real questions** - Every query should answer a question
- **Break down complex queries** - Start simple, add complexity step by step
- **Use meaningful names** - Table aliases should make sense (s for students, c for courses)
