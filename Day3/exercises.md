## 💡 Tips for Solving

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic problems and gradually move to advanced ones
2. **Multiple Approaches**: Try to solve each problem in at least 2 different ways
3. **Edge Cases**: Always test with empty strings, single characters, and special characters
4. **Efficiency**: Think about time and space complexity
5. **StringBuilder**: Use StringBuilder when building strings in loops
