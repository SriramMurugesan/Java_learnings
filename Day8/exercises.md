# Day 8 Exercises - Collection Framework

## ArrayList Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Operations
Create an ArrayList of integers, add 5 numbers, and print:
- The list
- Size of the list
- First and last elements

### Exercise 2: Remove Even Numbers
Create an ArrayList with numbers 1 to 10. Remove all even numbers and print the result.

### Exercise 3: Find Maximum
Create an ArrayList of integers and find the maximum value without using Collections.max().

## LinkedList Exercises

### Exercise 4: Queue Implementation
Use LinkedList to implement a simple queue. Add 5 customers and serve them in FIFO order.

### Exercise 5: Reverse a List
Create a LinkedList with elements and reverse it using LinkedList methods.

## ArrayDeque Exercises

### Exercise 6: Palindrome Checker
Use ArrayDeque to check if a string is a palindrome.

### Exercise 7: Browser History
Implement browser back/forward functionality using ArrayDeque.

---

## PriorityQueue Exercises

### Exercise 8: Top 3 Students
Given student names and scores, use PriorityQueue to find top 3 students.

### Exercise 9: Merge K Sorted Lists
Use PriorityQueue to merge multiple sorted lists into one.

---

## HashSet Exercises

### Exercise 10: Remove Duplicates
Given an array with duplicates, use HashSet to remove duplicates and print unique elements.

### Exercise 11: Common Elements
Find common elements between two arrays using HashSet.

---

## TreeSet Exercises

### Exercise 12: Range Query
Create a TreeSet of numbers and find all numbers in range [20, 50].

### Exercise 13: Sorted Unique Words
Read a sentence and print all unique words in alphabetical order using TreeSet.

---

## LinkedHashSet Exercises

### Exercise 14: First Non-Repeating Character
Find the first non-repeating character in a string using LinkedHashSet.

### Exercise 15: Preserve Order
Given a list with duplicates, remove duplicates while preserving the original order.

---

## Mixed Exercises

### Exercise 16: Collection Comparison
Compare the performance of ArrayList vs LinkedList for:
- Adding 10000 elements at the beginning
- Accessing elements by index

### Exercise 17: Set Operations
Implement union, intersection, and difference operations on two sets.

### Exercise 18: Frequency Counter
Count the frequency of each element in a list using HashMap (preview for next topic).

---

## Challenge Exercises

### Exercise 19: LRU Cache
Implement a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using LinkedHashSet.

### Exercise 20: Task Scheduler
Create a task scheduler that processes tasks based on priority using PriorityQueue.
